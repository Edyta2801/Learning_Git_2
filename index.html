    <h1>THE BALLAD OF SLOWNESS </h1>
    <h4>by Herman de Coninck</h4>
    <br>
    <article>
        <p>I love the slowness of lying on grass, like a king:</p>
        <p> me, looking out and surveying my adherents,</p>
        <p> my extremities, telling my left arm:</p>
        <p>you there, convey my hand to my mouth</p>
        <p>that I might yawn, that's right,</p>
        <p>and now lie down again, excellent,</p>
        <p>I must have discipline.</p><br>

    <article>
        <p>I love the slowness of being,</p>
        <p>Zen, they say in the East, I believe</p>
        <p>it's the same thing.</p>
        <p>I love the slowness of lying in bed,</p>
        <p>you next to me, with your knees behind</p>
        <p>my knees, like a double S, the slowness with which</p>
        <p>you haven't told me yet that you're awake,</p>
        <p>your responsiveness consisting of lips,</p>
        <p>the slowness with which I come faster and faster,</p>
        <p>the calmness with which I grow wilder and wilder,</p>
        <p>the slowness of your diplomatic body</p>
        <p>that gives and takes, your corps diplomatique,</p>
        <br>
    </article>
    <article>
        <p>and the slowness of a cigar afterwards,</p>
        <p> the slowness of grandeur, the slowness of someone</p>
        <p>smashing his car into a tree in slow</p>
        <p>motion, the majesty of explosion, solemn,</p>
        <p>solemnly ends this life.</p>
        <br>
